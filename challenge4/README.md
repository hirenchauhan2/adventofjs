# Challenge 4 - Keyboard


## Brief

In this project, we're going to create a computer keyboard.

## Users should be able to:

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling

## Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Keep track of how many keys are successfully typed correctly, the first time.
- Keep track of how many keys are missed
- Time the user to see how many successful key presses they can get within a given amount of time.
